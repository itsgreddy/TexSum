A web app which aims at generating summary consisiting of few sentences that captures salient features of text data from different types of text data sources using **Abstractive Text Summarization Technique** via  Natural Langueage Processing(NLP).

# Project Description

## What It does ?
Our Text Summarizing Tool is an AI-based tool that sums up large paragraphs into a few sentences. Summarized text usually has vital sentences that are an overview of the whole context. Project TexSum summarizes the long paragraphs or long-form content into a text summary and provides a JSON output. Alternatively, if there are web articles, PDFs, and other formats, uploaded by the user, the web app can summarize the critical content into bite-sized information.
